            <h1>Disbursement of Scholarship</h1>
            <p>The scholarship towards academic fees will be paid directly to the Institution as per claim or as per rate fixed by the respective State Fee Regulatory Authority or as fixed by any Regulatory Authority appointed by the Government, whichever is less and within the overall ceiling fixed for the course.</p>
            <p>All the Institutions may note that the upper ceiling of the Academic Fee inclusive of all admissible components taken together is ₹1,25,000/- for the Professional / Engineering Stream; ₹30,000/- for General Stream and ₹3,00,000 for Medical Stream.</p>
            <p>Even if the total fee of the institute is more than the ceiling, neither AICTE shall reimburse the extra amount nor the institute can charge the same from the students.</p>
            <p>The fixed maintenance allowance of ₹1,00,000 per annum for all streams will be paid to the bank account of the student through DBT using the PFMS gateway.</p>

            <h2>Duration of Scholarships</h2>
            <p>The scholarships granted under the scheme are renewed in subsequent classes subject to good conduct and maintenance of attendance as prescribed by the respective institution.</p>
            <p>Students failing to get promoted to the next class/level would get the scholarship in the following year subject to the condition that if the student fails again for the second time, then he/she would forfeit the scholarship, and the scholarship would not be renewed for the subsequent years.</p>
